This analysis can help to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market. It will be helpful in deciding
significant variables in predicting the price of a car and how well those variables can describe the price of a car.

Initial Data Wrangling and cleaning to understand data and gain preliminary insights. Checking for correlations/dependency of variables, and other assumptions prior to model building and algorithm deployment. Model developement and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms :

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
